## Introduction

Welcome to our Signal Composer project! This PyQt application is a versatile tool for signal composition and analysis. This user-friendly application simplifies the process of working with signals, making it easy to create, modify, and analyze them. The core purpose of the Signal Composer project is to provide a platform for users to manipulate signals with precision. You can craft your own custom signals or sample existing ones for further analysis. This project is particularly useful for various applications such as digital signal processing, communications, audio processing, and beyond.

## Features

### Signal Composer

The "Signal Composer" tab offers a range of features to help you create and fine-tune your signals:

- **Composing Signals:** In this tab, you have the ability to define signals by specifying their essential characteristics, including frequency, amplitude, and phase shift.

- **Signal Layering:** Create complex composite signals by stacking multiple signals on top of each other. This feature is valuable for simulating real-world signal scenarios.

- **Signal Deletion:** The application provides a straightforward way to remove any unwanted signals from your composition. This allows you to experiment and iterate effectively.

### Signal Sampler

The "Signal Sampler" tab is where you can analyze and process signals, and it provides several important functionalities:

- **Sinc Interpolation:** Use sinc interpolation to sample and recreate your signals. This technique ensures high-fidelity signal reproduction during analysis.

- **CSV File Import:** If you have signals stored in CSV files, you can easily load them into the application for analysis and comparison.

- **Max Frequency Detection:** The project can automatically detect and display the maximum frequency present in the loaded signal, aiding in signal characterization.

- **Noise Addition:** Introduce noise to your signals for more realistic testing and to simulate real-world scenarios that often involve background noise.

- **Sampling Frequency Adjustment:** Adjust the sampling frequency to accurately recreate the signal according to your specific requirements or test scenarios.

- **Real-Time Error Calculation:** One of the most notable features is the application's ability to calculate and display the error in real-time as you make adjustments. This feedback is invaluable for signal analysis and refinement.

These features empower users to work with signals efficiently and provide a dynamic environment for signal composition, sampling, and analysis.
